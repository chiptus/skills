# Fallback: gh is missing

Reached from `SKILL.md` only when Phase 1's `command -v gh` check comes back
empty (e.g. a remote/cloud session with no `gh` CLI, relying on the
`mcp__github__*` tools instead). Skip this file entirely when `gh` is available.

## Phase 1: fetch threads

Reconstruct the same `{threads, reviews, issueComments}` shape from
`mcp__github__pull_request_read`. This skill's `allowed-tools` grants no git
command, so don't try to derive owner/repo/PR number by shelling out: use
what you already know about the repo from this session's own context (its
scope, working directory, or what the user told you), and ask the user for
the PR number if it's genuinely ambiguous:

- `method: get_review_comments` → review threads. Each has `id` (the GraphQL
  thread node ID: this is what `resolve_review_thread` below needs, keep it),
  `is_resolved`, `path`, `line`, and `comments[]` with `author`/`body`. Keep
  only `is_resolved == false` (the tool doesn't filter this for you the way
  the script's `jq` does).
- `method: get_reviews` → review bodies; keep only non-empty `body`.
- `method: get_comments` → top-level PR/issue comments (the script's
  `issueComments`).

## Phase 4: resolve and reply

- Resolve a thread with `mcp__github__resolve_review_thread`, passing the
  thread's GraphQL `id` (kept from `get_review_comments` above).
- A reply, if the user wants one posted:
  - Inline thread reply: `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment`
    with the numeric comment ID from the thread's comment `html_url` (the
    `#discussion_r<id>` suffix, not the thread's GraphQL `id`).
  - Top-level PR comment: `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`.
